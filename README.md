## How it works:
1. At the first start you enter your login data from Instagram _(*)_.
2. Then copy the post link you want to comment on and paste it into the text field "Post URL".
3. After that you choose the browser you use. You have 4 possibilities:
    - Firefox
    - Chrome (version 87, 88)
    - Edge (x64 version 88 - 90)
    - (Safari - coming soon)
   - Here's how to check your browser version:
      - Open your favorite browser
      - In the top right corner you will find 3 dots / dashes
      - Click on these dots / dashes and go to settings or info.
      - Next to the name of your browser you should see the version.
      - Under Chromium based browsers (like Chrome or Brave)
        <br>you can also enter "chrome://version" in the search field.
4. Now you can go to "Run".
5. You will then be prompted to enter sentences which you want to comment.
   <br>You also have the option to import an already existing .txt file with comments.
   <br>For this you go to "Settings" and import your comments under the label "Comments".

_(*) Your data will not be uploaded anywhere, they are stored only on your computer and are not visible to anyone._


## Works for:
The program may not work for all hardware.
<br>It has been tested so far under the following system:
- Windows 8 (x64)
- Windows 10 (x64)

_Maybe it doesn't work for MacOS (OSX) and Linux,
<br>because there are differences in the encoding method.
<br>But I will work on getting the program to work for these systems._
